<h1>Linux downloads (Debian)</h1>
<p>
PostgreSQL is available in all Debian versions by default. However, the
stable versions of Debians "snapshot" a specific version of PostgreSQL
that is then supported throughout the lifetime of that Debian version.
Other versions are available in the Debian <i>backports</i> repositories.
</p>
<p>
Should packages not be available for your distribution, or there are
issues with your package manager, there are graphical installers available.
</p>
<p>
Finally, most Linux systems make it easy to build from source.
</p>

<h2>Included in distribution</h2>
<p>
Debian includes PostgreSQL by default. To install PostgreSQL on
Debian, use the <i>apt-get</i> (or other apt-driving) command:
</p>
<code>
apt-get install postgresql-9.1
</code>
</p>
<p>
The repository contains many different packages including third party
addons. The most command and important packages are (substitute the
version number as required):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>postgresql-client-9.1 - client libraries and client binaries</li>
 <li>postgresql-9.1 - core database server</li>
 <li>postgresql-contrib-9.1 - additional supplied modules</li>
 <li>libpq-dev - libraries and headers for C language frontend development</li>
 <li>postgresql-server-dev-9.1 - libraries and headers for C language backend development</li>
 <li>pgadmin3 - pgAdmin III graphical administration utility</li>
</ul>

<h2>Debian backports</h2>
<p>
Newer versions of PostgreSQL for older versions of Debians are available
in <a href="http://backports.debian.org/">Debian backports</a>. For
information on how to enable and use the backports repository, please
see the
<a href="http://backports-master.debian.org/Instructions/">backports instructions</a> page at Debian.
</p>
<p>
Once backports is enabled, you can install PostgreSQL the same way as with
the builtin repositories.
</p>

<h2>Graphical installer</h2>

<p>
One click installers are available for 32 and 64 bit Linux distributions
and include PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, PL/Java and the PL/pgSQL debugger plugin.
The installer has been tested with a number of recent Linux distributions
and should work on Ubuntu 6.06 and above, Fedora 6 and above,
CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and above and others.
</p>
<p>

the packages from EnterpriseDB.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note: The one click installers do not integrate with
platform-specific packaging systems.</b>
</p>

<h2>Build from source</h2>
<p>
The source code can be found in the main <a href="/pub/source">file browser</a>.
Instructions for building from source can be found in the
<a href="/docs/current/static/installation.html">documentation</a>.
